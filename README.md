# JDWPClient
Note this project is no longer maintained!

I used this to experiment with implementing a JDWP client in Qt / C++.
I later implemented more of the protocol in [Envision](https://github.com/dimitar-asenov/Envision) and built a debugger for it. 
You can find the more complete JDWP Protocol implementation in the [Envision Source Tree](https://github.com/dimitar-asenov/Envision/tree/development/OODebug/src/debugger/jdwp)
A description of the implementation in Envision can be found in my [research project report](http://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/infk/chair-program-method/pm/documents/Education/Theses/RS_report_Lukas_Vogel.pdf) in chapter 3.2.2
